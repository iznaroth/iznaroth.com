                <i className='opacity-30'>At the bottom, where bits of the inverted well-rim broke free and tumbled into open sky, it became clear I hadn't found my mark. One 
                shotty knot - that, or something cut the rope - and I was set to confront it directly. Unfamiliar lands stretched out beneath, foreign stars glared from on high, 
                nothing but miles of cold air either way. Behind me, the suspended well-mouth pinched into a line and faded away, spitting one last brick into the clouds. <br /><br /> 
                Evensink, the Teeth of Ages, world-wound - the bedrock of the universe. No going back now...</i>
                <br /> <br /><br />  
                <i>Down the Worldwell</i> is a game about broken places and the timid folk that claim to own them. It is about the strains, stresses and disorders
                of an old, unpredictable world at the bottom of the universe, the <i>last stop</i> on every limb of the outer cosmos. The homesteaders call it Dornn--the Broken Lands--
                so frequently visited by catastrophe the ground itself can no longer properly hold shape. Held and lost for millenia by the vaunted legions of the old world, stolen by the temperamental
                shoves of the immortal Human Empires, desperately protected by the surviving Inheritors, it is a knotted sprawl of superstructural ruin and discordant anti-nature.  In these suffocated lands, now governed only
                by recluses, immortalesques and deranged ideologues, where no map nor road can reliably lead you where you wish to go, it falls to the <b>Travellers</b> to keep the world alive.
                <br/><br/>
                In Down the Worldwell, your players will pilot Travellers, the bold-or-foolish few who forsake the paranoid comfort of ruin-state life to hunt for fame, money, history, truth and purpose across Dornn's ever-shifting frontiers.
                Life is a challenge in the Dornnian wilds, where disaster-warped creatures of unknown intent stalk the realm, world-law is fickle, the gods are unresponsive and magic is terribly unstable. 
                <br/><br/>
                Taking inspiration from both OSR-style high-stakes fantasy a.la Lamentations of the Flame Princess and Cairn and ultra-high-magic nonsense beyond even D&D's scope, Down the Worldwell's system is a medium-weight TTRPG about 
                strange abilities and strategic sacrifice. Travellers can freely acquire abilities across the <i>arcs</i> of different Tactical Occupations as they accumulate different forms of experience. Be wary--combat is highly lethal, injury is difficult to rectify, and everything hinges on
                the delicate balance of magically-induced <i>strain</i> on the stability of the real.

                Though the setting guide for Down the Worldwell is not yet complete, this site will always contain the essential information for players to create characters and GMs to acquaint themselves with the setting.
                Eventually, if you're willing to wait it out, I might just publish a full-meat system and setting guide. In that strange far-future world, the guide may even include stuff like this:
                <br /><br />
                <ul className='text-left text-lime-200 list-disc px-10'>
                    <li>13 playable ancestries with a lot of weird history and bonuses</li>
                    <li>15 "tactical occupations", extended power trees that describe different combat pursuits.</li>
                    <li>More than 100 occupation-agnostic abilities you can throw at your players. </li>
                    <li>Hundreds of strange items, where they came from, and who wants them.</li>
                    <li>Loads of foreign and dangerous creatures to throw at your players.</li>
                    <li>A positively stupid amount of tables for generating people, places and things.</li>
                    <li>Hundreds of pages of gibberish lore, locations, relationships and systems to use as idea fodder.</li>
                    <li>A long timeline upon which you can etch your campaign stories anywhere. </li>
                </ul>

                The links at the top will take you through the basics of the system. <b>The System</b> will teach you the rules, <b>The World</b> will give you way too much 
                information about the legendary realms of Dornn, <b>Character Creation</b> will help automate some of the fiddlier aspects of making a new PC, and 
                <b>The Assembly</b> is for my West Marches players only, for now. There are no physical materials for Down the Worldwell (yet!), and much of this site is currently under construction.
                This project is currently a noncommercial hobby by a single person. Progress will be immeasurably slow and bound to my real-world obligations. My apologies for the wait.

                While the system-particulars of Down the Worldwell do not prescribe a particular tone, there are a few implied content warnings. Your table ought to be comfortable with more grounded
                depictions of severe injury, death, mental strain and various traumas. In addition, the included material on the Dornn setting will occasionally depict the social and political issues that plague
                the varied fantasy species of the realm. While no content in Down the Worldwell is intended to represent or resemble anything in the real world, there will inevitably be familiar concepts.
