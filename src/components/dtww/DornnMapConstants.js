  Dornn is a large, convoluted and foreign place. It's built on the bones of classic high fantasy (owing to its roots as a reworking of WoTC's D&D staples for homebrew's sake), but exposed to a lot of paranoid rethinking and
  value drift. It's centered on the Midlands, three re-re-shattered continent-archipelago things that play host to a mess of magically-paralyzed politicking. A long history of divine convolution, depths-secreting, meddlesome intruders
  and unexpected immortal super-expansionists has crushed and rewritten the realm into something that only scantly resembles the high-Modern familiars it pulls from. Dornn is big, overfull with confusing interests and predicated on a lot of
  repeatedly-recalibrated world-law.
  <br /> <br />
  As an adventuring setting, Dornn is thematically between the extremes of "miserycrawl" high-consequence low-heroics adventures and "mad-magical superscience" romps in a world where you're always too close to the naked Truth. It is an old place, lousy with
  history-rewriting disasters and incomprehensible meddlesome powers. Despite being a high-magic setting, the Strain system from Down the Worldwell is built to demonstrate why magic isn't very widespread or trusted in Dornn - being completely unpredictable
  and very prone to error. This puts adventurers in a unique position - they can get a lot stronger, but their odds of doing so aren't as skewed as they may expect. It's a bumpy road to the summit. 
  <br /> <br />
  While the setting has many different time periods to work with, most everything is written for the <b>Seasons of Stagnation</b>, a time shortly after the immortal Human Empires have faltered in the face of rediscovered power and
  unexpected failures in their so-called perfect immortality. This is a period following a long series of societal collapses and planar catastrophes, a time without well-maintained roadways or usable
  long-distance communication. The empires of this age are weak and dependent on old-world tech that no longer functions how it used to (the Gods have changed their minds concerning some things), and the Human Empires
  did not do a good job at rebuilding global communications or transport. In the wake of their gradual disappearance, everything has backslid into a bit of a frontier mindset - outside of the more established city-states and towns,
  borders are ill-controlled and governments struggle to maintain a grasp on their citizenry. The majority of the plane is a ruin-washed wilderness, populated only by strange beasts and opportunistic sellswords. 
  <br /> <br />
  This page is not intended to fully describe Dornn, just to aid in creating characters that make sense and planning broader objectives as a party. As I publish more modules and content, the shape of Dornn will become clearer, and I may periodically
  update this page to reflect changes and other useful information. If I do, this content will be delineated as "[X]-SPOILER", where [X] represents a particular piece of content you can filter for. Some questions will never be answered, though - if I did that,
  there'd be no point in using the setting at all.  
  <br /> <br />
  Dornn is far too big to map comprehensively. There is always room to add your own stuff! Nestle towns in new areas, write new histories, change the fates of entire species if you want. The point of a fictional setting is in providing inspiration--this is about helping your mental garden flourish.
  Steal what works and bin the rest.

  <br /><br />
  Dornn is an old name. To some, it's the common neologism for every foreign recess; visiting foreigners claim it as the holiest of the Internal Spheres, others still say it’s nothing but a pile of rubble at the center of the Godsgarden’s oldest fountain. Regardless of your experiences, history converges on Dornn - and the records are never flattering. Host of the first, land of the Mortals, the true-and-only-Cradle. Once three great continents, shattered and beaten over by the ages.  Stumbling into the place is easy, as simple as crawling through the wrong crack in the back of an old keep, peeking too deep into a forested cave, taking home the wrong gemstone brooch. Getting out is another story, subject to the tumult of the universe’s sole pressure-point like a waterfall tide from every outward direction. It’s best to think of Dornn as a bottomless well - unfortunately for you, these lands too deep to crawl from.
  <br /><br />
  These isles - the Midlands, as they're oft referred - have died more times than you will, seen catastrophes you’d struggle to picture, and played host to stranger creatures than you could ever aspire to be. Some brave few survive on the bones of this ancient place, rebuilding cities and repaving roadways that are always doomed to another eventual collapse. Others still linger in the far corners of the unlit realm, idly working away at the long-ladder to total ascendancy // divine interruption. In every recess, from the star-sworn spires of old-world war-lands to the time-dead depths of the cyclical-amnesiac underworld, the memories of a millennium realm take shape: ancient prizes, esoteric beasts, impossible fortresses, limitless power. As you may expect, this is where you come in. 
  <br /><br />
  There remains some semblance of the civilizations that held these isles in the days of yore, but they are weak and information is scarce. Failures in magical networking, aggressive paramilitary pressganging and stubborn political isolationism have caused a problem: the roads are overgrown, and most people aren’t talking. Old world infrastructure remains, so you can trace the shape of these undead nations with some ease, but you won’t find any help in the towns they connect. Ten paces beyond the town limits and you’re on your own. This in-of itself wouldn’t be as much of a problem, unfortunately, if the geography wasn’t so traitorous.
  <br /><br />
  By most estimations, Dornn has “died” six or seven times before you arrived. With each death, the geographies and metaphysics of the realm have been liberally reworked. Maps are rarely accurate, physical law is woefully inconsistent, politics are strained and fractured and always lousy with conspiracy. Some think that the whole of it is controlled by a roomful of quasi-Gods that have solved the Magical Answer, and they’ve long-since killed the old divines and taken their place. It isn’t an unreasonable belief to hold.
  <br /><br />
  Yet, if power were so easy, we wouldn’t still be fighting. Magic is a boon, but a fickle one. Absent gods leave strange systemics in their wake, local stability is always a step from disaster, and the Great Ladder corrupts and fortifies in equal measure. For each step you take towards ascendancy, you must lose something in return. Plenty of fools take the gamble. Plenty more are content to do the good work and keep their heads down. It’s up to you exactly where you fall on this axis. 
  <br /><br />
  We live, now, in the Seasons of Stagnation. Once stomped under the boot of the immortal Human Familial Empires, their grand migratory seclusion has left their cities and highways quite-nearly abandoned, and those they left behind are either too powerful to bother or already on the run. Their unconditional immortality has lost its appeal over the centuries, acting more as a torturous guarantee of eternal pain than a promise of dominating power. Never forget the laws of the Haze, and always have a plan to kill them again. 
  <br /><br />
  It was a mere seventy cycles ago when the Wireless Admonition God elected to change the law of signal, and so we continue to redraw maps and resurrect ancient routes in uneasy global silence. For us common mortals, this would be called a disaster. Others do not see it that way. Behind the curtain, grand wheels of fate and games of legendary cosmic warfare skew the realm’s future into dark uncertainties. The greater average of this tired plane may be frail, but there is no ceiling to this house, nor is there any shortage of maniac mana-drunk foes to challenge your climb. Wars are played at levels of scale; we’re always puppets to a higher rung. Maybe it’s better to start looking for the string. 
  <br /><br />
  ---------------------
  <br /><br />
  The charted lands of Dornn are split into three "continents." The term is a holdover from a time when they were still whole. To the west is Dornnus, the Cradle, active host to about ninety percent of all living mortals.
  It is a vast realm, mostly characterized by perpetual squabbles between the parasite empires that live off the firmament of old-world ruins. The whole of it was brought to heel by the Five Human Families about a thousand years prior, but their grip 
  has been steadily weakening for several centuries. Immortality is no longer the boon it once was, as their attempts to stifle the progress of science and magic have been slowly overtaken. Unfortunately, the preexisting betrayals of divine worldwork have made the recovery of old technology a slow and torturous process, so wars are still fought with steel, spells, fists and teeth.
  <br /><br />
  In the center of the Sea of Dvirn are the forgotten realms of Ferveirn, the Golden Lands. Once the beating heart of the Dvirran empire, it has been ransacked and devoured many times since their failure to
  conquer the plane (and subsequent disappearance.) The Rhominite inheritors with the most legitimate claim to the realm currently control the seats of Ilkair, the gilded capital, but Elvish holdouts have remained a stubborn
  factor for as long as the Dvirr have been missing. The eastern half of Ferveirn is under varying levels of quarantine - the old capital of Moz Haphora cannot be entered by any living soul,
  lest they volunteer their freewill to Alavaria, the King-under-Sky.
  <br /><br />
  To the east is the frost-wracked frontier wasteland of Jurdenogh. It was once a vibrant mirror to the cultural varieties of Dornnus, but the follies of the Glassblood youngest embroiled the continent itself
  in a metaphysical concept-superwar between ancient deities, freezing the whole thing ten times over. The poor sods that still live there are pretty much stuck--for a mortal, traversal is almost certain death. For a human, it's just a lot of consecutive certain deaths. There's surely a bounty of unclaimed treasure to be found
  in the mostly-untouched ruins that cover the continent, but it would be a costly trip in both coin and mental fortitude.

A very long time ago (<i>long before any surviving records can accurately recount</i>), the great gestalt Diravol was born of raw Transcendence, and through their merciful intellect was the physical interstice of Dornn created. In Diravol’s bipedal image, a great many creatures were made to populate this land - we call them the Mortals. They are the foremost sapients of the realm - but they are not the only ones. The First Inheritors are followed by many; the Strangers, the Visitors - a wide arc. 
<br /><br />
These are the fourteen with the greatest primacy of control in the Seasons of Stagnation.

<h2>Humans</h2>
<p>
The Immortal Intruders, unfeatured primals. Arrived late to the cradle of Dornn, without the wit, wisdom or burdens of the Mortal Inheritors. Once cursed to a life of vagrancy and frequent slavery, their ancestors brokered a deal with an outsider and gained nigh-unconditional Immortality. Any injury suffered is revoked in a day’s time or less, no matter the severity. They are the isolationist governors of most of the Midlands. 
<br/><br/>
The Human lifecycle is a distorted mockery of natural existence, mimicking age by way of slowly permitting the divine frustration to loosen their shape. Given enough time, any Human will slowly degrade into a foggy ball of soul-lightning and emotionless memory, an indefinite repetition of pains and broken empathic links lacking any semblance of life, mobility, or speech.

<h2>Ascendants</h2>
<p>
The Extended Other, those from higher rungs. As varied as one could imagine the mortal form to be - yet still imposed upon by the bipedal ghost. Anything and everything you could imagine, misplaced and thrown into Dornn without much warning. Lacking in agency and usually stuck under the boot of an Inheritor empire. 
<br/><br/>
There are an uncountable number of unidentified Visitors, but about 37 codified Ascendant species hold some territory in the Midlands. Certain groups of Ascendant have grown notorious enough to be granted their own category on the list - these are somewhat callously called the “descended”. 
<br/><br/>
Some of the most notorious descended are the Dragons and their progeny, star-crawling pseudo-reptiles from higher on the chitinous leg of the Outer Kosmos. They arrived in a prismatic bolt of dislodged theory long before the First Age, laying their brood wide and low in the recesses of the Earlyworld in wait; biding time for mortal bounties to proliferate and ripen.

    <h2>Constructs</h2>
    <p>
    Children of Balam Arts; the Artificial Mind. Creating a Mortal from the composite parts of the world surrounding. The art of Golemancy was so fundamentally satisfying to world-law, it ascended the creator to the next stage. Imparting a soul to inert matter is partaking in the sacred acts of the Patrons, of Diravol, of the first. Constructs are venerated for this proximity to the divine, but not widely advocated or understood due to their relative rarity.

    <h2>Dragonborn</h2>
    <p>
    The oft-maligned descendants of Red-Eye, presiding arch-wyrm of the surviving Dragons. Miserable products of ethical failure; the magi-eugenic offspring of Kalamant’s empathic forges. The scaly form of the Wyrm bent into awkwardly bipedal, Mortal shape--illegitimate participants in the Inheritor’s game. Constantly searching for a method of felling their parriarchs and freeing themselves from the heritor’s curse. Powerfully resistant to all forms of attack, magic or otherwise, but also nearly all conventions of medicine and mend.

    <h2>Dvirr</h2>
    <p>
    The lost four-armed fanatics of the Golden Age. Lanky, tall-yet-hunched, distended faces sporting three-odd eyes wreathed by ornate masks. Once the miracle-machinists of the early-world, these slight and angular bipeds were enthralled by their patron, Oridei, into a world-scarring war that nearly killed off the entirety of Mortal existence. In the wake of their loss, those that were spared the guilt were slowly dragged back into the Alavarian incumbent by strange ripples from below the crust. They are almost entirely missing in the Seasons of Stagnation.

    <h2>Dwarves</h2>
    <p>
    The vast and all-encompassing heart of the Midlands; an impossibly-varied group of subterranean beard-born bureaucrats and bellows-masters. Most often compared to ants; the Dwarves are split innumerably into variable castes of physical size, depth of living, sociocultural role, divine tendency and arbitrary judgements of appearance. From the triple-jointed jagged-shouldered Dhuroi of the deep-citadels to the waxy Ezym tallborn of the upper governmental circles, Dwarves were categorized less for their resemblances and more for their attitudes towards progress, industry and democracy. In deep-time, they emigrated to their vast subterranean citadels and disappeared entirely. They are not present in the Seasons of Stagnation.

    <h2>Elves</h2>
    <p>
    The neurotic geometers of Eryulithas' endless surveying. In earlier times, they were identified by their tall and wiry frames, knife-shaped ears and pointed, almost sculpted features--they were often called Forest Giants. Now, in the long shadow of the Pointlords' disastrous reconfigurations, it’s pretty much just the ears. Elvish bodies are inextricably marked by strange polygonal scarworks, the inescapable reminder of their near-total informational ascent in the First Age. 
    <br /><br />
    Elves are everywhere, shattered-and-scattered as they were by the Elfwars of the early ages.  Elvish tribes can resemble anything from stony elementals to pallid pseudo-vampires--such is the nature of their chimerical past. They make up the bulk of most Mortal populations.

    <h2>Faelikes</h2>
    <p>
    The abandoned compromise between the Fae-body purisms of energy and the more understated material composition of the Mortal form. Formally nonspecific--they can kind-of look however they want, if they have the time. The Fae are gone now, having fled the incessant incursions the Demons would wreak on their territory. Their children are not so lucky. Faelikes are the only mortals made partially out of magic - unlike any other mortal, if cut-off from Transcendent energies, they will die. Every part of a Faelike’s body is worth a king’s ransom, too--they’re either hiding or on the run, no matter what.

    <h1>The Splitfolk</h1>
    <p>
    In the seedling days of yore when the Mortal Inheritors were first planted, there came to be a creature known as the Unsplit. It was a pluripotent superorganism, a wanting thing nearly-guaranteed to bring disaster to its peer-species. In a moment of wary prescience, Diravol deigned to take this advantage literally, and so they sliced the Unsplit in twain, making from it two distinct peoples.

    The top half were the Gnomes, granted a mercy of quicksilver legs upon which to walk the earth. Despite the gift, they still stand at about a meter-and-change. Not all accepted this gift, taking their burden as a challenge, and thus was born their tendency to tinker. As heritors of the upper-body, the Gnomes were burdened with an unspent mind of early-world power and a monstrously-tough upper torso.  They used this unusual toolset to build grand sequesters of ornate construction in the deepwood mountains of the north, sickeningly-vertical jungle-gyms of silver and gold that wreathe the chasms of the old Krangsway. At some point, disaster ejected them from their homelands and burdened them with a curse of broken memory.

    The bottom half were the Halflings, granted a meager earthwork fitting over their soul-ember torsos. With the fires of ambition contained, they secreted their habits away in order to focus on family. They’re approximately as tall as their Splitfolk siblings, their  squat bodies of two complexions - the legs are briar-knotted, musclebound and gnarled relics of old-world power, while the torso is an intricate golem of swirling earthwork - crafted so flawlessly, they are nearly indistinguishable from common mortals.  Halflings are the Earthen-Kings of the southern mountain-lands, overly-accommodating and somehow in everyone’s good graces. You can find them pretty much everywhere.

    Hezzar’s progeny; the chattering end. In the stubby interstitial plate that divides the Midlands from the unmeasured depths, a bounty of strange creatures have been granted a drop of the Mortal Sapience. The exact source of their ascension is contested. They are diverse of form, resembling all manner of insects - just a bit stonier in composition. They almost all hail from the great choke of Hezzar’s Pit, just under the centermost bruises of Dalumgrahd.

    Perhaps the most diligent of the First Age’s Inheritors, the Northfolk are still, in fact, in the North. Broad-shouldered, hardy, vibrantly-colored and toothy bipeds that keep great academies and vast fortress networks in the northern wastes of Anterros and Dolwynd. In the first age, their consecutive loss of two patrons to the nighmare-desert of the Ruvallian has imposed upon their bodies a spiral lock-like scar; a promise to Tann that the debt will be repaid in time. If one of their teeth is embedded, they will die. This promise has split their kin into two subspecies - the Fireborn who hold the war-lines against would-be invaders, and the Unstoked that quell and contain their burning blood to keep themselves against the impossible cold of the far North, often sporting a coat of platinum fur.

Most-identifiable for their taller physiques, bone-like head fixtures (horns?) and unusually-colored sclera, the Rhôminites are otherwise more diverse of form than even the Dwarves were. They are an awkward unification of a host of isolated kingdoms and clans, forced into cooperation when their millionmind patron Kar-deil was killed to make room for their own futures (Rhôminite Summit Zero, it was called) and the subsequent falling-out led to the birth of the Hand of Rhômi, one of the two worst Demon-Cults of the modern age. They are still marked by the results of many prior falling-outs, including the amputation phantoms of post-Dvirran summits and the hole-scar that marks their promise: to fell the Hand by any means necessary.

    <h2>Theodryians</h2>
    <p>
    The mythic cryptid namesakes of the Theodryian Sea, a tremendously isolationist nation of bifurcated superliminal colossi. The Theodryians were one of the eight Mortal Inheritors, but their First Age struggles isolated them before contact was made. Theodryians are about as tall as Rhôminites on average, have an ash-gray skin tone, and are usually hairless. Their features are blocky and squared-off and their heads terminate in unusually shaped ‘crownbones’ that are used to identify one-another (though some can still grow hair as well). 
    <br /><br />
    The Theodryian soul is split in two, an attempt at understanding the ramblings of their magic-obsessed patron that burned an irrevocable mark on all subsequent Theodryian souls. One is the physical host--the Materiosapience--whereas the other is the transcendent communicator, the Ethereosapience. This makes Theodryians outlandishly talented spellcasters, but also renders them distractible and inattentive.
