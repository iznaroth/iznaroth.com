    <h1 className="orange">What's the Pitch?</h1>
  </div>
  &emsp;&emsp;Dornn is a large, convoluted and foreign place. It's built on the bones of classic high fantasy and RPG cliche, 
  but exposed to several years of redraft and elaboration. It's centered on the Midlands, three re-re-shattered continent-archipelago-amalgams that play host to a mess of 
  magically-paralyzed politicking. A long history of divine convolution, depths-secreting, meddlesome intrusion and unexpected immortalesque manifest destiny has crushed and
   rewritten the realm into something that only scantly resembles the high-Modern familiars it pulls from. Dornn is big, overfull with confusing interests and predicated on 
   a lot of repeatedly-recalibrated world-law.
  <br /> <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;As an adventuring setting, Dornn is thematically between the extremes of "miserycrawl" high-consequence low-heroics adventures and "mad-magical superscience" romps 
  in a world where you're always too close to the naked Truth. It is an old place, lousy with history-rewriting disasters and incomprehensible meddlesome powers. 
  Despite being a high-magic setting, the Strain system from Down the Worldwell is built to demonstrate why magic isn't very widespread or trusted in Dornn--being almost
  completely unpredictable and very prone to error. This puts adventurers in a unique position--they can get a lot stronger, but their odds of doing so aren't as 
  skewed as they may expect. It's a bumpy road to the summit. 
  <br /> <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;While the setting has many different time periods to work with, most everything is written for the <b>Seasons of Stagnation</b>, a time shortly after the immortal 
  Human Empires have faltered in the face of simmering tensions, constant rebellion and unexpected failures in their so-called perfect immortality. This is a period following a long 
  series of societal collapses and planar catastrophes, a time without well-maintained roadways or usable long-distance communication. The empires of this age are 
  weak and dependent on old-world tech that no longer functions how it used to (the Gods have changed their minds concerning some things), and the Human Empires
  did not do a good job at rebuilding global communications or transport. In the wake of their gradual disappearance, everything has backslid into a bit of a 
  frontier mindset--outside of the more established city-states and towns, borders are ill-controlled and governments struggle to maintain a grasp on their 
  citizenry. The majority of the plane is a ruin-washed wilderness, populated only by strange beasts and opportunistic sellswords. 
  <br /> <br /> <br />

  <br /> <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;This page is not intended to fully describe Dornn, just to aid in creating characters that make sense and planning broader objectives as a party. As I publish more 
  modules and content, the shape of Dornn will become clearer, and I may periodically update this page to reflect changes and other useful information. If I do, 
  this content will be delineated as "[X]-SPOILER", where [X] represents a particular piece of content you can filter for. Some questions will never be answered, 
  though--if I did that, there'd be no point in using the setting at all.  
  <br /> <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;Dornn is far too big to map comprehensively. There is always room to add your own stuff! Nestle towns in new areas, write new histories, change the fates of entire 
  species if you want. The point of a fictional setting is in providing inspiration--this is about helping your mental garden flourish.
  Steal what works and bin the rest.

  <br /><br />
  The charted lands of Dornn are split into three "continents." The term is a holdover from a time when they were still whole. 
  <br /><br />
  To the west is <b className="green">Dornnus, the Cradle</b>, active host to about ninety percent of all living mortals.
  It is a vast realm, mostly characterized by perpetual squabbles between the parasite empires that live off the firmament of old-world ruins. The whole of it was brought to heel by the Five Human Families about a thousand years prior, but their grip 
  has been steadily weakening for several centuries. Immortality is no longer the boon it once was, as their attempts to stifle the progress of science and magic have been slowly overtaken. Unfortunately, the preexisting betrayals of divine worldwork have made the recovery of old technology a slow and torturous process, so wars are still fought with steel, spells, fists and teeth.
  <br /><br />
  In the center is the <b className="orange">Sea of Dvirn</b>, crowned by the forgotten realms of <b className="gold">Ferveirn, the Golden Lands</b>. Once the beating heart of the Dvirran empire, it has been ransacked and devoured many times since their failure to
  conquer the plane (<i>and subsequent disappearance.</i>) The Rhominite inheritors with the most legitimate claim to the realm currently control the seats of Ilkair, the gilded capital, but Elvish holdouts have remained a stubborn
  factor for as long as the Dvirr have been missing. The eastern half of Ferveirn is under varying levels of quarantine--the old capital of Moz Haphora cannot be entered by any living soul,
  lest they volunteer their freewill to Alavaria, the King-under-Sky. The surrounding sea is a perpetual frontline between the federated clans of Deilān and their cult-warped ancestors, the Hand of Rhômi.  
  <br /><br />
  To the east is the frost-wracked frontier wasteland of <b className="blue">Jurdenogh.</b> It was once a vibrant mirror to the cultural varieties of Dornnus, but the follies of the Glassblood youngest embroiled the continent itself
  in a metaphysical concept-superwar between ancient deities, freezing the whole thing ten times over. The poor sods that still live there are pretty much stuck--for a mortal, traversal is almost certain death. For a human, it's just a lot of consecutive certain deaths. There's surely a bounty of unclaimed treasure to be found
  in the mostly-untouched ruins that cover the continent, but it would be a costly trip in both coin and mental fortitude. 
  <br /><br />
  The specifics of Dornnian lands and life are constrained by many strange rules and reactions. The details are trapped in the inconsistencies of the land, its natural inhabitants, 
  and the strange principles that stabilize and govern their existence--at least, as we understand them.
  </p>
  <p id="" className='text-white m-auto !text-left w-5/6 pb-20 block'>
  <div className="wwheader text-left">
    <h1 className="green">Geographic Confusions</h1>
  </div>
  The Dornnian mantle is strange and uncooperative; the cartographer's vocation is one of many redrafts and no small amount of risk. Nobody really agrees on how it's all held together--from theories of 
  semisapient tectonics to incomprehensibly precise magical contract, the only real certainty is the stuff that everything's made of. Where it is, and whether it will be there tomorrow? That's up for debate. 
  The root of these confusions lies in how space misbehaves; mountainlinks and burrows.
  <br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;Most agree that the mountains are all (<i>or mostly</i>) bodies--dead titans, worms and other earlyworld artifacts. A hazy fog of nostalgia still hangs over their compressed-and-interleaved selves,
  intermittently linking and swapping highmountain passes and other such chambers without any mortal-comprehensible purpose. This can make crossing unreinforced passes anything from a hassle to a disaster.
  <br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;The forests, on the other hand, are the recursive self-loathing territory of the absent Fae, and in the wake of their abandonment, the trees have grown irate. Reliable methods of navigation
  through the deepwoods of Dornn are worth a nation's vault if you can prove they work. Otherwise, you're either navigating through very old infrastructure or rolling the dice.
  <br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;The seas are vast, open, and unshielded; prime territory for outer meddling. There isn't a body of water in all the Midlands that remains unwatched and unscathed--it may make
  for faster traversals, but you're a lot more likely to run into something along the way, for better or for worse. Pinches, tide-titans, reflection-skating geists and constricted channels can reroute
  and divert seemingly-locked-on voyages in almost no time at all. Let us not forget the source of the great channels that divide the masses apart; fulcrum-spirits of the divine wars of the Exits: the congealed rages of Astra Alumbarré, Mholdûr,
  and the million competing fragments of their identity-decay ages.
  <br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;While the remainder of the realm's major biomes are less prone to disastrous reconfiguration, that's not a promise--the realm is lousy with bottomless ruins and uncharted reaches, still shifting
  under millennia of accumulated curses, wards, and other convolutions of transcendent stability. That, too, is excepting the worst of it--we are seated upon a thin table of stone defaced by vaults and chasms,
  gateways to the mad meander of the Underworld--a realm unmapped and unsettled even in the heights of the old-world Golden Ages, save for a meager handful of gentle, shallow caverns and venerated magical vaults.
  <br /><br />
  <br /><br />
  <div className="wwheader text-left">
    <h1 className="purple">Ecological Patterns</h1>
  </div>
  Attempts at classifying the creatures of Dornn and the regions they inhabit is something of a fool's errand. Some literature has been recovered from prior ages, documenting more considerable and
  consistent efforts at the task, but in the wake of nearly eleven thousand years of magical disaster and environmental decimation, a disappointing amount of it is useless. 
  <br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;The problem is with manipulation: no creatures can be reliably related to one another when the transcendent static always threatens to manipulate their bases. Instead, Dornnians have broadly
  classified creatures based on their relation to the Transcendence; to what degree is the creature made from organics, inerts, transcendent composites, or raw energy. Further categories have bee created out of necessity--
  there are still outliers.
  <br /><br />
  In the Seasons, the academics prefer a modified form of the <i>Marclight Conventions for Ecological Delineation</i>:
  <br /><br />
  <ul className='text-left text-lime-200 list-disc px-10'>
    <li><b>Animalia:</b> Concerning creatures of fully-organic composure, intermittently capable of interfacing with the Transcendence. </li>
    <li><b>Plantae / Partemplantae:</b> Concerning sedentary organics and their transcedentally-infused counterparts. </li>
    <li><b>Minisculae: </b> Concerning hypothetical organics that exceed the minimum size of possible observation. </li>
    <li><b>Lithoid:</b> Concerning creatures predominately composed of stone and other minerals, with no clear transcendent link. </li>
    <li><b>Partemfungi:</b> The most extensive technical subfamily of Partemplantae--sapient, usually-mobile fungi with convoluted transcendent relationships. Distinguished as a root-level convention due to the insistence of old-world researchers for unknown or unrecorded reasons.</li>
    <li><b>Inframagi:</b> Concerning creatures with a nonzero ratio between biological physiology and transcendent physiology. </li>
    <li><b>Magi:</b> Concerning creatures entirely composed of transcendent energies. </li>
    <li><b>Incognitas:</b> Ill-understood creatures that fall between Inframagi and some other axis; composed of exotic or unknown energies and materials. Generally hostile to Mortal life. </li>
    <li><b>Conscientia:</b> Concerning a narrow family of creatures composed entirely of physical sapience. </li>
    <li><b>Intorsum:</b> Concerning the broader groups of creatures that manifest as extensions of collective thought. </li>
    <li><b>Memoria:</b> Concerning creatures with physiologies that were rendered incompatible during the Exits or prior disasters, persisting through unknown means. </li>
    <li><b>Cosmolaria:</b> Creatures that hail from the skies beyond the Dornnian table and generally fail to obey even the fundamental laws of Dornnian physics. </li>
  </ul>
  <br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;Most ecologists have given up, leaving this system unrefined and prone to crossover. It is still traditionally used to identify and categorize new creatures for hunts and travel strategy.
  <br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;Concerning environs, there is no consistent resource, as Dornn's climate and regional structure is in a massively-unstable state. Consensus holds that the 
  heat is a gift from Era, the cold from the Forgotten, and all other principles of the natural world are confusions of these old gifts--superstitious, but there isn't much else
  to go on. It is advised that you consult the above materials, map and  outlines to gain an understanding of the various biospheres of the Midlands, and do extensive research before planning any expeditions.
  <br /><br />
  <br /><br />
  <div className="wwheader text-left">
    <h1 className="red">Physics and Transcendence</h1>
  </div>
  Magic is the long-and-short of it. Nobody agrees on what it is--most folks trade in confused speculation and primeval legend, particularly the frail handful that have survived from
  the mouth of the maester-patron Diravol at the dawn of the mortal world. It is at least understood that any sapient being can "access" the Transcendence and directly manipulate
  any principles of reality so long as they can sufficiently articulate their intent. To do so requires a lot of janky shortcutting, as no single mortal could ever sufficiently
  articulate their intent to the incomprehensible wailing of the full-body Transcendence.
  <br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;These shortcuts are unreliable, built off of millenia of trial-and-error, transcribing certain effects into symbolics, prayers, somatics and behaviors. Most of them rely in some way on 
  the Gods; even less-understood gestalts that seem to preside over the natural world in unpredictable ways. There are an uncounted number of names, words and symbols for these Divines, muddled further
  by the vast cultural melds of the Seasons of Stagnation. Unlike the frail corporeals of the pre-Exits world, modern divines are akin to spirits--distant, uncooperative, annoyingly cryptic. Thus,
  the process of rediscovering their transcendent methods is a strenuous one. Some may provide physical agents to aide in the process (<i>the Icons</i>), but these creatures usually end up causing massive natural disasters
  rather than furthering any pursuits of knowledge. If you haven't picked up on it, religion is not a supremely-consistent or widespread practice in the realms of Dornn--it can be rather risky, and the Divines don't seem to 
  punish the unfaithful unless directly provoked.
  <br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;Understanding this poses a dangerous question: what <i>can't</i> be screwed up by magic? The answer is nothing. To live in Dornn is to trust nothing. It is a mercy, then, that the risks tend to contain themselves.
  Whatever fundamental rules govern this reality, they resist the fallout that transcendent manipulation can incur--while local reality will suffer <i>Gedt Cascades</i> and other destabilizations as people overuse magic, 
  strange and ineffable processes conspire to repair the firmament wherever it is broken--usually after the offending casters are dead and gone. A minor mercy. 
  <br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;For the Dornnian everyman, this means that magic is the most imposing of double-edged swords. It's possible for just about anybody to put in the work (<i>though natural talent and the strange proximities
  of various cursed heritages can shift this meter</i>), but even the slightest misuse of magic can be devastating for the caster, and dealing a lot of collateral damage without just killing yourself first is hard. It keeps itself in line,
  to some degree, and so most folks don't mingle much with the transcendent realm, only seeking the supernatural as it suits the subtleties of their day-to-day. Innovation and automation of magic is a common ambition amongst structured societies,
  as indicated by many a Golden Age utopian super-ruin, but frequent misfires and the vast swathes of magical ruleshift suffered in the Exits has made technology something of a pipe-dream, for now. Sometimes it's best to keep yr. head down.

  A very long time ago (<i>long before any surviving records can accurately recount</i>), the great gestalt Diravol was born of raw Transcendence, and through their merciful intellect was the physical interstice of Dornn created. In Diravol’s bipedal image, a great many creatures were made to populate this land--we call them the Mortals. They are the foremost sapients of the realm--but they are not the only ones. The First Inheritors are followed by many; the Strangers, the Visitors--a wide arc.

  <h2>Humans</h2>
  <p>
  The Immortal Intruders, unfeatured primals. Arrived late to the cradle of Dornn, without the wit, wisdom or burdens of the Mortal Inheritors. Once cursed to a life of vagrancy and frequent slavery, their ancestors brokered a deal with an outsider and gained nigh-unconditional Immortality. Any injury suffered is revoked in a day’s time or less, no matter the severity. They are the isolationist governors of most of the Midlands. 
  <br/><br/>
  The Human lifecycle is a distorted mockery of natural existence, mimicking age by way of slowly permitting the divine frustration to loosen their shape. Given enough time, any Human will slowly degrade into a foggy ball of soul-lightning and emotionless memory, an indefinite repetition of pains and broken empathic links lacking any semblance of life, mobility, or speech.

      The Great Project, all of Diravol's myriad mimics. Though their physiques vary, they have been forced to match the bipedal stature of the eldest Tender for reasons unknown. When each of their Earlyworld ancestors were gifted with the power of intellect,
      they began to corporealize shards of Diravol's will into the earliest divines--the Patrons. In the Seasons, they scarcely resemble their oldest forms, having suffered the worst side-effects of Dornn's magical frustration. Overburdened by heritage-curses
      and lost histories, the Inheritors continue to struggle against the lost convolutions of their old-world destinies as they beat back the borders of their Human neighbors.

      <p>
      The lost four-armed fanatics of the Golden Age. Lanky, tall-yet-hunched, distended faces sporting three-odd eyes wreathed by ornate masks. Their culture was one of secrets; their language a rotating puzzle-box of unneeded complexity. They apparently had a distaste for recording their thoughts, perhaps due to the precision of their memory and their strange teaching techniques.<br/><br/>
      Once the miracle-machinists of the early-world, these slight and angular bipeds were enthralled by their patron, Oridei, into a world-scarring war that nearly killed off the entirety of Mortal existence. In the wake of their loss, those that were spared the guilt were slowly dragged back into the Alavarian incumbent by strange ripples from below the crust. They are almost entirely missing in the Seasons of Stagnation.

      into variable castes of physical size, depth of living, sociocultural role, divine tendency and arbitrary judgements of appearance. From the triple-jointed jagged-shouldered Dhuroi of the deep-citadels 
      to the waxy Ezym tallborn of the upper governmental circles, the notion of a Dwarf stood less for their resemblances and more for their attitudes towards progress, industry and democracy. In deep-time,

Now, in the long shadow of the Pointlords' disastrous reconfigurations, it’s pretty much just the ears. Elvish bodies are inextricably marked by strange polygonal scarworks, the inescapable reminder of their near-total informational ascent in the First Age.

      Elves are everywhere, shattered-and-scattered as they were by the Elfwars of the early ages.  Elvish tribes can resemble anything from stony elementals to pallid pseudo-vampires--such is the nature of their chimerical past. They make up the bulk of most Mortal populations.

      In the seedling days of yore when the Mortal Inheritors were first planted, there came to be a creature known as the Unsplit. It was a pluripotent superorganism, a wanting thing nearly-guaranteed to bring disaster to its peer-species. In a moment of wary prescience, Diravol deigned to take this advantage literally, and so they sliced the Unsplit in twain, making from it two distinct peoples.

      taking their burden as a challenge, and thus was born their tendency to tinker. As heritors of the upper-body, the Gnomes were shouldered with an unspent mind of early-world power and a monstrously-tough 
      upper torso.  They used this unusual toolset to build grand sequesters of ornate construction in the deepwood mountains of the north, sickeningly-vertical jungle-gyms of silver and gold that wreathe

      old-world power, while the torso is an intricate golem of swirling earthwork--crafted so flawlessly, it can be hard to spot the difference.  Halflings are the Earthen-Kings of

      fortress networks in the northern wastes of Anterros and Dolwynd. In the first age, their consecutive loss of two patrons to the nighmare-desert of the Ruvallian has imposed upon their bodies a spiral

      the Rhôminites are otherwise more diverse of form than even the Dwarves were. They are an awkward unification of a host of isolated kingdoms and clans, forced into cooperation when their millionmind patron 
      Kar-deil was killed to make room for their own futures (<i>Rhôminite Summit Zero, it was called</i>) and the subsequent falling-out led to the birth of the Hand of Rhômi, one of the two worst Demon-Cults of

      The mythic cryptid namesakes of the Theodryian Sea, a tremendously isolationist nation of bifurcated superliminal colossi. The Theodryians were one of the eight Mortal Inheritors, but their First Age struggles isolated them before contact was made. Theodryians are about as tall as Rhôminites on average, have an ash-gray skin tone, and are usually hairless. Their features are blocky and squared-off and their heads terminate in unusually shaped ‘crownbones’ that are used to identify one-another (<i>though some can still grow hair as well.</i>) 
      <br /><br />
      The Theodryian soul is split in two, an attempt at understanding the ramblings of their magic-obsessed patron that burned an irrevocable mark on all subsequent Theodryian souls. One is the physical host--the Materiosapience--whereas the other is the transcendent communicator, the Ethereosapience. This makes Theodryians outlandishly talented spellcasters, but also renders them distractible and inattentive.

      standards of Diravol suffers unusual repercussions; mistakes in the worldweave that neglected the idea of non-Inheritor life. While Humans suffer the brunt of it, life is still difficult for the others beyond the
      whims of the Tender's council--everything from magical misfire to cumbersome prophecy will haunt them for as long as they remain here, unless they falsify their transcendent identities entirely. Despite this, many remain in the Midlands their entire lives. Some due to stubbornness,
      but usually it's just because nobody knows how to leave.

  <h2>Ascendants</h2>
  <p>
  The Extended Other, those from higher rungs. As varied as one could imagine the mortal form to be--yet still imposed upon by the bipedal ghost. Anything and everything you could imagine, misplaced and thrown into Dornn without much warning. Lacking in agency and usually stuck under the boot of an Inheritor empire. 
  <br/><br/>
  There are an uncountable number of unidentified Visitors, but about 37 codified Ascendant species hold some territory in the Midlands. Certain groups of Ascendant have grown notorious enough to be granted their own category on the list--these are somewhat callously called the “descended”. 
  <br/><br/>
  Some of the most notorious descended are the Dragons and their progeny, star-crawling pseudo-reptiles from higher on the chitinous leg of the Outer Kosmos. They arrived in a prismatic bolt of dislodged theory long before the First Age, laying their brood wide and low in the recesses of the Earlyworld in wait; biding time for mortal bounties to proliferate and ripen.

The scaly form of the Wyrm bent into awkwardly bipedal, Mortal shape--illegitimate participants in the Inheritor’s game.
      They can vary greatly in size and shape--some hardly differentiated from their mortal cousins, others towering meters above the bulkiest Theodryian, all claws and hard angles.
       Constantly searching for a method of felling their parriarchs and freeing themselves from the heritor’s curse. Powerfully resistant to all forms of attack, magic or otherwise, but also nearly all conventions of medicine and mend.

Their children are not so lucky. Faelikes are the only mortals made partially out of magic--unlike any other mortal, if cut-off from Transcendent energies, they will die. Every part of a Faelike’s body is worth a king’s ransom, too--they’re either hiding or on the run, no matter what.

    <p id="padding-scrunch">
    Reformed many times in the wake of worldshaking disaster, the Midland Council is the soul and spine of Dornnian peacetime. Their existence is not a symbolic platitude--the Council 
    is the fulcrum of all traditional politics, the mediator, and an armed force backed by the Sword-Saints that will frequently stamp out potential conflict. In a world where the 
    threat a single rogue agent poses can be planar, the highest level of mortal organization must have the power to decisively prevent such catastrophes. This has, does, and will 
    cause problems when they take action too hastily without full-body consultation.
    <br /> <br />
    The Human Families have tentatively agreed to hold seats at the Council in the years following Draid’s “final” incursion. Their representatives will attend any summit deemed sufficiently-severe, which has only happened
    three times since.

  History is unkind to the Midlands. Most of it has been lost by way of catastrophe, be it cosmic or political, and that which remains paints a confused picture. Many wedges 
  block the way; modern inhabitants hardly resemble their old-world counterparts, forgotten keepers of the times when Gods and Mortals mingled and warred across the unscarred promise of the preludes. 
  What has instead lasted beyond records of their exploits, imprinted across the flesh and blood of their descendants, are the remnants of their worst mistakes.  Through body-law we 
  trace the truth of Dornnian history, and it is strange indeed.

      In time unmeasured, a trillion years before and after, the Old Gods fought endlessly on battered planes of undecided matter. Their forms were perfect energies, maintained tantrums of thought and instrument. 
      Their origins and intentions were not known, but from their perpetual orbit was born the Laws of Reality. It was a time of imprecision, indecision and lots of energy. 
      <br /> <br />
      Somewhere in that roiling sea of every-thought, an incidental clash gave birth to Diravol, the Tender. To abridge their many miracles, the great Patron would be the only "living" creature
      to forge a meaningful relationship with the Old Gods, brokering the six primal Contracts required for Transcendence to mimic the shape of mortal-habitable reality. Life, death, time, space, reason and consequence.

      The Inheritors struggled to build sensible relationships with their neurotic patrons, and the inextricable differences between them and their neighbors only served to worsen the attempt.

      Oridei had been seeing things for a time. It isn’t certain when or why the King-under-Sky selected him as proper vessel, only that it imposed on his mind for much of the First. A lingering suite of repetitive nightmares: A table in the throat of the heavens with the body of Diravol’s only son seated at one side. 
      A million swords embedded in the windless plains of Moz Haphora’s rolling cradle. Dead titans crashing into manarotted grass. Grey-skinned limbs in ornate boxes. Stormshattered 
      cities in the superstructural depths. A centipede of mortal arms clinging to a blackstone nail at the bottom of the world. The sky as a pastiche of wings and arms, 
      returning home to lift the plane up and away from the growing dark. 
      </i>
      <br /> <br />
      The prophecies remember it well; the turning of the age as a realization of one Divine's ceaseless nightmares. It was perhaps the only extensively documented part, the massive mental decline of Oridei of the Dvirr, the world's
      only "sane" corporeal divine, as he was beset by an outsider's hostile visions. When none would respect his calls to action, he took it upon himself to enact the will of Alavaria, the King-under-Sky, and declared war on the world. 
      At first it was a brief and unremarkable string of assassinations and heists. Then, the wings came. A halo of words and light and feathered triumph descended from an overcast sky over Moz Haphora, crowning the Dvirran initiative with the blessing of the Other. 
      Things got a lot worse after that.
      <br /><br />
      The Dvirran wars spanned an age and change, if the records are to be believed. It was the war to end all wars, one not even bested in the grand futures to come. Millions died at the hands 
      of the great Dvirran war-engine, a wanton massacre that culled arbitrarily without reason or remorse. Those that were spared were not forced to work, but to convert--to adopt the will of the
      outsider entity to which Oridei had promised the plane. In the times when they were not fighting (<i>and they were usually fighting</i>), the Dvirr would expend vast quantities of wealth and construct strange devices across the whole of the Midlands,
      many of which still stand today, uncounted millennia later. The war calendar flexed and withered over the centuries, rebellions swelling into empires before the winged vanguard would return to collect. 
      <br /><br />
      The war's end was only found when Oridei's prophecy-addled hubris ran against a foe he could not topple, and he was killed in remarkably mortal fashion. 
      His immortal patronly soul survived, rattling madly in his corpse-cage, but not fiercely enough to avoid recovery and imprisonment. His remaining forces were abandoned by their new Godhead and stomped out in a meager decade.

      <br /> <br />
      This highpoint in a post-patron world is long and fogged, the vast swathes of time wherein most every ruin was built and lost. The technological highs of the Golden Age were riding a wave of magical comprehension so absurd, we might as well be banging rocks together in comparison. Much of the knowledge is foreign to us, based on principles that are dysfunctional in the Seasons of Stagnation. More still was destroyed in the subsequent ages, so the narrow slice of understanding we have for the Golden Age is strange. It was something of a misnomer. 
      <br /> <br />
      The shape of it is vague, a star-crawl to intellectual ascendance marred by complicated and unexpected disaster. The Dwarves built grand subterranean societies that dragged them deeper than they could handle, the Dvirr could not escape their patronly fate and vanished in exodus, the Gnomes met something old in the Krangsway and were scarred forever, the Northfolk were cursed by the death of their second god-chieftain,  the Halflings were shattered by the death of the Mountaincarver hosts, the Elves were fractured and tempted by fragments of their patron's neurotic theories, the Rhominites were devastated by constant internal warfare, and nobody really knows what was going on with the Theodryians. Some groups made it through less-distorted by this age of knowledges, as far as we can tell, but their records are no more complete than any others. There's little in the way of specifics for any of these narratives, only the broadest arcs that survived through legend and word-of-mouth.
      <br /> <br />
      We call it the Golden Age because they managed to stop fighting one another quite as much, but they couldn't quell the internal strife. Narrow history recalls naught but the diplomatic stresses of this meteoric age, political squabbles and roundtable councils nearly destroying the world--if not for what burnt that fuse prematurely...

      Inelegant failures of the Mortal Adherence. Synchronicity is a strange thing; we are wont to accuse the Gods of manufacturing coincidence, when the truth is simpler--there's just a lot of stuff. Sometimes, a lot of one-in-a-trillion happenstances just so happen to line up nicely. 
      In the wake of divine abandonment and repeated patricide, the Inheritors have been deserted by the faith. All the vectors of progress begin to lean inward--disaster 
      looms. Every juncture meets in one narrow corridor. It could have been anything, from the folly of unchecked advancement to the widening gaps in planar coherence. 
      Plenty of theories. Personally, I just think the poor thing just couldn't handle the pressure. Searing, blistering mana-blitzed static killed three quarters of the 
      world in something akin to an instant. Tyrannical wars between the malcontents of the Upper Spheres carved at the planar crust, scarring landmasses with psychic trenches 
      and phantasm-boundaries. The trillion hands of antimortal intent emerged from every corner of the realm to weigh this new advantage. Things fell apart.

      Faith suffocated, the skies closed like a wound finally healed, and the Midlands were left to rot in blacksun silence; in dead time. The world was wreathed in a 
      paralyzing darkness, lit intermittently by vast bolts of outsider energy that streaked across an empty sky in riverlike patterns. Worldlaw was brittle, time was 
      inconsiderate, space was incoherent. The world grew dependent on the Confidences, narrow strips of land or sea that behaved with a semblance of predictability. 
      Records estimate this Age lasting anywhere from fifteen to six thousand years, depending on the place. Histories were kept through word-of-mouth and the varieties 
      of body-curse observed in corpses from the period--even text did not always work as expected. 
      <br /> <br />
      For most, this age was long and torturous, involving many attempts at reconstructing society that met with extreme opposition. Fresh-formed divinities rejected old 
      magic, rendering nearly all technology useless. A host of new and foreign creatures had invaded the fractured plane, making transport and communication extremely 
      difficult. Something was meddling with the recording and transfer of information, devastating the surviving libraries and storehouses. Most every political body 
      larger than a single settlement died off. Something was lost in this age; separated from the boons of their work, the mortals changed over millennia to adapt to 
      this hostile new paradigm. We only narrowly understand this change, having lost most recorded evidence of it, but it appears that modern mortals do not precisely 
      resemble their old-world counterparts. 
      <br /> <br />
      Sometime, somewhere, the Humans arrive without warning. Dead-world paranoia seats them firmly at the bottom of the power-ladder, as the only mortal creatures 
      without legacy or family to carry them through the dark ages. Their early history is muddled and confused, a foggy mess of subterranean migrations. 
      Nobody recognizes them.

      The realization of Oridei's ambition through differing means. A deal was brokered between five Human visionaries and a nameless titan from the eastern isles, one that 
      would both break the death-spell over the plane and free the Human enclaves from their reclusive masters. It was a bad deal, one even a fool ought to refuse--in exchange 
      for their right to naturality, they would be granted "unconditional immortality." None of the familial parriarchs will comment on why they accepted the bargain.
      <br /> <br />
      While the Human populations were not of one mind regarding this newfound trait, it did not take long for enough of them to rally to their new leaders. In the confused 
      and disorganized Seasons of Regression, no empire was nearly strong enough to fight at all, let alone against a wall of unkillable, vindictive foes. The plane was 
      steamrolled in less than a century with minimal resistance. Sometime during the Invasions, the Old Gods managed to reclaim the celestials, and the shredded sky 
      was restored to old form.
      <br /> <br />
      The Human Age is marred by the confusing political re-evaluations of a deathless empire. As the Humans became more acquainted with their new lifecycles 
      (<i>and the horrid strains it would place upon their bodies</i>), waves of panic and confusion would repeatedly shake at their grasp. Many answers were 
      proposed to solve the issues of overpopulation, mental degradation, divine imposition and magical conspiracy. None took, and the relations between the 
      five human families began to degrade--an opportunity that would allow many of the Inheritors to reclaim some of their old glory.

      <br /> <br />
      Many failures in organization have caused the Human Empires to shrink. The reports grow worse with each passing century; nervously recounting the gradual breakdowns 
      of the Human body in the face of even this meager infinity. They may not die, but their options are unenviable--fall prey to the increasingly popular perpetual 
      death-machines, have your capacity for emotion stolen by a Beast of Causality, or watch as your physical form glacially ages past the precipice of reasonable 
      function, rendering you immobile and thought-strained for an ever-extending eternity. Most retreat in the face of this realization. About seventy-eight percent 
      of all Humans emigrate to the superstructural city-peninsula of Dyrit, where the Sleeping-Halls entomb their consciousness in a kind of suspended animation for 
      the rest of their lives (<i>ergo, forever</i>).
      <br /> <br />
      As the Human Empires slowly crumble under these existential winds, the Mortals begin to retake their old lands. The Humans did a mediocre job of fixing up
       the post-Armageddon landscapes, so much of the world is a stilted and disjointed array of repopulated ruins and devastated highways. Squabbles 
       between Human holdouts and Mortal bannermen are frequent, but more common are the incursions met between surfacegoers and the newfound host of deranged, 
       ancient Other--Demons, misaligned, and other such things.
      <br /> <br />
      The work ahead is long and difficult. Magic is once again foreign and mostly unknown, technology is traitorous and distrusted (<i>policed, as well</i>), 
      faith is uneasy and based on confusing partial-history, and there are far too many unrecorded hostiles for anyone to contend with. While the massive 
      shadow of Human settlement may have granted a semblance of inhabitability to the plane, it will be a while before the ruin-scarred reaches of Dornn are understood.
