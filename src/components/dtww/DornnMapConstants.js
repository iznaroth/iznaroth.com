  Dornn is a large, convoluted and foreign place. It's built on the bones of classic high fantasy (owing to its roots as a reworking of WoTC's D&D staples for homebrew's sake), but exposed to a lot of paranoid rethinking and
  value drift. It's centered on the Midlands, three re-re-shattered continent-archipelago things that play host to a mess of magically-paralyzed politicking. A long history of divine convolution, depths-secreting, meddlesome intruders
  and unexpected immortal super-expansionists has crushed and rewritten the realm into something that only scantly resembles the high-Modern familiars it pulls from. Dornn is big, overfull with confusing interests and predicated on a lot of
  repeatedly-recalibrated world-law.
  <br /> <br />
  As an adventuring setting, Dornn is thematically between the extremes of "miserycrawl" high-consequence low-heroics adventures and "mad-magical superscience" romps in a world where you're always too close to the naked Truth. It is an old place, lousy with
  history-rewriting disasters and incomprehensible meddlesome powers. Despite being a high-magic setting, the Strain system from Down the Worldwell is built to demonstrate why magic isn't very widespread or trusted in Dornn - being completely unpredictable
  and very prone to error. This puts adventurers in a unique position - they can get a lot stronger, but their odds of doing so aren't as skewed as they may expect. It's a bumpy road to the summit. 
  <br /> <br />
  While the setting has many different time periods to work with, most everything is written for the <b>Seasons of Stagnation</b>, a time shortly after the immortal Human Empires have faltered in the face of rediscovered power and
  unexpected failures in their so-called perfect immortality. This is a period following a long series of societal collapses and planar catastrophes, a time without well-maintained roadways or usable
  long-distance communication. The empires of this age are weak and dependent on old-world tech that no longer functions how it used to (the Gods have changed their minds concerning some things), and the Human Empires
  did not do a good job at rebuilding global communications or transport. In the wake of their gradual disappearance, everything has backslid into a bit of a frontier mindset - outside of the more established city-states and towns,
  borders are ill-controlled and governments struggle to maintain a grasp on their citizenry. The majority of the plane is a ruin-washed wilderness, populated only by strange beasts and opportunistic sellswords. 
  <br /> <br />
  This page is not intended to fully describe Dornn, just to aid in creating characters that make sense and planning broader objectives as a party. As I publish more modules and content, the shape of Dornn will become clearer, and I may periodically
  update this page to reflect changes and other useful information. If I do, this content will be delineated as "[X]-SPOILER", where [X] represents a particular piece of content you can filter for. Some questions will never be answered, though - if I did that,
  there'd be no point in using the setting at all.  
  <br /> <br />
  Dornn is far too big to map comprehensively. There is always room to add your own stuff! Nestle towns in new areas, write new histories, change the fates of entire species if you want. The point of a fictional setting is in providing inspiration--this is about helping your mental garden flourish.
  Steal what works and bin the rest.

  <br /><br />
  Dornn is an old name. To some, it's the common neologism for every foreign recess; visiting foreigners claim it as the holiest of the Internal Spheres, others still say it’s nothing but a pile of rubble at the center of the Godsgarden’s oldest fountain. Regardless of your experiences, history converges on Dornn - and the records are never flattering. Host of the first, land of the Mortals, the true-and-only-Cradle. Once three great continents, shattered and beaten over by the ages.  Stumbling into the place is easy, as simple as crawling through the wrong crack in the back of an old keep, peeking too deep into a forested cave, taking home the wrong gemstone brooch. Getting out is another story, subject to the tumult of the universe’s sole pressure-point like a waterfall tide from every outward direction. It’s best to think of Dornn as a bottomless well - unfortunately for you, these lands too deep to crawl from.
  <br /><br />
  These isles - the Midlands, as they're oft referred - have died more times than you will, seen catastrophes you’d struggle to picture, and played host to stranger creatures than you could ever aspire to be. Some brave few survive on the bones of this ancient place, rebuilding cities and repaving roadways that are always doomed to another eventual collapse. Others still linger in the far corners of the unlit realm, idly working away at the long-ladder to total ascendancy // divine interruption. In every recess, from the star-sworn spires of old-world war-lands to the time-dead depths of the cyclical-amnesiac underworld, the memories of a millennium realm take shape: ancient prizes, esoteric beasts, impossible fortresses, limitless power. As you may expect, this is where you come in. 
  <br /><br />
  There remains some semblance of the civilizations that held these isles in the days of yore, but they are weak and information is scarce. Failures in magical networking, aggressive paramilitary pressganging and stubborn political isolationism have caused a problem: the roads are overgrown, and most people aren’t talking. Old world infrastructure remains, so you can trace the shape of these undead nations with some ease, but you won’t find any help in the towns they connect. Ten paces beyond the town limits and you’re on your own. This in-of itself wouldn’t be as much of a problem, unfortunately, if the geography wasn’t so traitorous.
  <br /><br />
  By most estimations, Dornn has “died” six or seven times before you arrived. With each death, the geographies and metaphysics of the realm have been liberally reworked. Maps are rarely accurate, physical law is woefully inconsistent, politics are strained and fractured and always lousy with conspiracy. Some think that the whole of it is controlled by a roomful of quasi-Gods that have solved the Magical Answer, and they’ve long-since killed the old divines and taken their place. It isn’t an unreasonable belief to hold.
  <br /><br />
  Yet, if power were so easy, we wouldn’t still be fighting. Magic is a boon, but a fickle one. Absent gods leave strange systemics in their wake, local stability is always a step from disaster, and the Great Ladder corrupts and fortifies in equal measure. For each step you take towards ascendancy, you must lose something in return. Plenty of fools take the gamble. Plenty more are content to do the good work and keep their heads down. It’s up to you exactly where you fall on this axis. 
  <br /><br />
  We live, now, in the Seasons of Stagnation. Once stomped under the boot of the immortal Human Familial Empires, their grand migratory seclusion has left their cities and highways quite-nearly abandoned, and those they left behind are either too powerful to bother or already on the run. Their unconditional immortality has lost its appeal over the centuries, acting more as a torturous guarantee of eternal pain than a promise of dominating power. Never forget the laws of the Haze, and always have a plan to kill them again. 
  <br /><br />
  It was a mere seventy cycles ago when the Wireless Admonition God elected to change the law of signal, and so we continue to redraw maps and resurrect ancient routes in uneasy global silence. For us common mortals, this would be called a disaster. Others do not see it that way. Behind the curtain, grand wheels of fate and games of legendary cosmic warfare skew the realm’s future into dark uncertainties. The greater average of this tired plane may be frail, but there is no ceiling to this house, nor is there any shortage of maniac mana-drunk foes to challenge your climb. Wars are played at levels of scale; we’re always puppets to a higher rung. Maybe it’s better to start looking for the string. 
  <br /><br />
  ---------------------
  <br /><br />
  The charted lands of Dornn are split into three "continents." The term is a holdover from a time when they were still whole. To the west is Dornnus, the Cradle, active host to about ninety percent of all living mortals.
  It is a vast realm, mostly characterized by perpetual squabbles between the parasite empires that live off the firmament of old-world ruins. The whole of it was brought to heel by the Five Human Families about a thousand years prior, but their grip 
  has been steadily weakening for several centuries. Immortality is no longer the boon it once was, as their attempts to stifle the progress of science and magic have been slowly overtaken. Unfortunately, the preexisting betrayals of divine worldwork have made the recovery of old technology a slow and torturous process, so wars are still fought with steel, spells, fists and teeth.
  <br /><br />
  In the center of the Sea of Dvirn are the forgotten realms of Ferveirn, the Golden Lands. Once the beating heart of the Dvirran empire, it has been ransacked and devoured many times since their failure to
  conquer the plane (and subsequent disappearance.) The Rhominite inheritors with the most legitimate claim to the realm currently control the seats of Ilkair, the gilded capital, but Elvish holdouts have remained a stubborn
  factor for as long as the Dvirr have been missing. The eastern half of Ferveirn is under varying levels of quarantine - the old capital of Moz Haphora cannot be entered by any living soul,
  lest they volunteer their freewill to Alavaria, the King-under-Sky.
  <br /><br />
  To the east is the frost-wracked frontier wasteland of Jurdenogh. It was once a vibrant mirror to the cultural varieties of Dornnus, but the follies of the Glassblood youngest embroiled the continent itself
  in a metaphysical concept-superwar between ancient deities, freezing the whole thing ten times over. The poor sods that still live there are pretty much stuck--for a mortal, traversal is almost certain death. For a human, it's just a lot of consecutive certain deaths. There's surely a bounty of unclaimed treasure to be found
  in the mostly-untouched ruins that cover the continent, but it would be a costly trip in both coin and mental fortitude.

  A very long time ago (<i>long before any surviving records can accurately recount</i>), the great gestalt Diravol was born of raw Transcendence, and through their merciful intellect was the physical interstice of Dornn created. In Diravol’s bipedal image, a great many creatures were made to populate this land - we call them the Mortals. They are the foremost sapients of the realm - but they are not the only ones. The First Inheritors are followed by many; the Strangers, the Visitors - a wide arc.

  <h2>Humans</h2>
  <p>
  The Immortal Intruders, unfeatured primals. Arrived late to the cradle of Dornn, without the wit, wisdom or burdens of the Mortal Inheritors. Once cursed to a life of vagrancy and frequent slavery, their ancestors brokered a deal with an outsider and gained nigh-unconditional Immortality. Any injury suffered is revoked in a day’s time or less, no matter the severity. They are the isolationist governors of most of the Midlands. 
  <br/><br/>
  The Human lifecycle is a distorted mockery of natural existence, mimicking age by way of slowly permitting the divine frustration to loosen their shape. Given enough time, any Human will slowly degrade into a foggy ball of soul-lightning and emotionless memory, an indefinite repetition of pains and broken empathic links lacking any semblance of life, mobility, or speech.

      The Great Project, all of Diravol's myriad mimics. Though their physiques vary, they have been forced to match the bipedal stature of the eldest Tender for reasons unknown. When each of their Earlyworld ancestors were gifted with the power of intellect,
      they began to corporealize shards of Diravol's will into the earliest divines--the Patrons. In the Seasons, they scarcely resemble their oldest forms, having suffered the worst side-effects of Dornn's magical frustration. Overburdened by heritage-curses
      and lost histories, the Inheritors continue to struggle against the lost convolutions of their old-world destinies as they beat back the borders of their Human neighbors.

      The lost four-armed fanatics of the Golden Age. Lanky, tall-yet-hunched, distended faces sporting three-odd eyes wreathed by ornate masks. Once the miracle-machinists of the early-world, these slight and angular bipeds were enthralled by their patron, Oridei, into a world-scarring war that nearly killed off the entirety of Mortal existence. In the wake of their loss, those that were spared the guilt were slowly dragged back into the Alavarian incumbent by strange ripples from below the crust. They are almost entirely missing in the Seasons of Stagnation.

Most often compared to ants; the Dwarves are split innumerably into variable castes of physical size, depth of living, sociocultural role, divine tendency and arbitrary judgements of appearance. From the triple-jointed jagged-shouldered Dhuroi of the deep-citadels to the waxy Ezym tallborn of the upper governmental circles, Dwarves were categorized less for their resemblances and more for their attitudes towards progress, industry and democracy. In deep-time, they emigrated to their vast subterranean citadels and disappeared entirely. They are not present in the Seasons of Stagnation.

      The neurotic geometers of Eryulithas' endless surveying.

Now, in the long shadow of the Pointlords' disastrous reconfigurations, it’s pretty much just the ears. Elvish bodies are inextricably marked by strange polygonal scarworks, the inescapable reminder of their near-total informational ascent in the First Age. 
      <br /><br />
      Elves are everywhere, shattered-and-scattered as they were by the Elfwars of the early ages.  Elvish tribes can resemble anything from stony elementals to pallid pseudo-vampires--such is the nature of their chimerical past. They make up the bulk of most Mortal populations.

      In the seedling days of yore when the Mortal Inheritors were first planted, there came to be a creature known as the Unsplit. It was a pluripotent superorganism, a wanting thing nearly-guaranteed to bring disaster to its peer-species. In a moment of wary prescience, Diravol deigned to take this advantage literally, and so they sliced the Unsplit in twain, making from it two distinct peoples.

      The top half were the Gnomes, granted a mercy of quicksilver legs upon which to walk the earth. Despite the gift, they still stand at about a meter-and-change. Not all accepted this gift, taking their burden as a challenge, and thus was born their tendency to tinker. As heritors of the upper-body, the Gnomes were burdened with an unspent mind of early-world power and a monstrously-tough upper torso.  They used this unusual toolset to build grand sequesters of ornate construction in the deepwood mountains of the north, sickeningly-vertical jungle-gyms of silver and gold that wreathe the chasms of the old Krangsway. At some point, disaster ejected them from their homelands and burdened them with a curse of broken memory.

      The bottom half were the Halflings, granted a meager earthwork fitting over their soul-ember torsos. With the fires of ambition contained, they secreted their habits away in order to focus on family. They’re approximately as tall as their Splitfolk siblings, their  squat bodies of two complexions - the legs are briar-knotted, musclebound and gnarled relics of old-world power, while the torso is an intricate golem of swirling earthwork - crafted so flawlessly, they are nearly indistinguishable from common mortals.  Halflings are the Earthen-Kings of the southern mountain-lands, overly-accommodating and somehow in everyone’s good graces. You can find them pretty much everywhere.

      Perhaps the most diligent of the First Age’s Inheritors, the Northfolk are still, in fact, in the North. Broad-shouldered, hardy, vibrantly-colored and toothy bipeds that keep great academies and vast fortress networks in the northern wastes of Anterros and Dolwynd. In the first age, their consecutive loss of two patrons to the nighmare-desert of the Ruvallian has imposed upon their bodies a spiral lock-like scar; a promise to Tann that the debt will be repaid in time. If one of their teeth is embedded, they will die. This promise has split their kin into two subspecies - the Fireborn who hold the war-lines against would-be invaders, and the Unstoked that quell and contain their burning blood to keep themselves against the impossible cold of the far North, often sporting a coat of platinum fur.

They are an awkward unification of a host of isolated kingdoms and clans, forced into cooperation when their millionmind patron Kar-deil was killed to make room for their own futures (Rhôminite Summit Zero, it was called) and the subsequent falling-out led to the birth of the Hand of Rhômi, one of the two worst Demon-Cults of the modern age. They are still marked by the results of many prior falling-outs, including the amputation phantoms of post-Dvirran summits and the hole-scar that marks their promise: to fell the Hand by any means necessary.

      <h2>Theodryians</h2>
      <p>
      The mythic cryptid namesakes of the Theodryian Sea, a tremendously isolationist nation of bifurcated superliminal colossi. The Theodryians were one of the eight Mortal Inheritors, but their First Age struggles isolated them before contact was made. Theodryians are about as tall as Rhôminites on average, have an ash-gray skin tone, and are usually hairless. Their features are blocky and squared-off and their heads terminate in unusually shaped ‘crownbones’ that are used to identify one-another (though some can still grow hair as well). 
      <br /><br />
      The Theodryian soul is split in two, an attempt at understanding the ramblings of their magic-obsessed patron that burned an irrevocable mark on all subsequent Theodryian souls. One is the physical host--the Materiosapience--whereas the other is the transcendent communicator, the Ethereosapience. This makes Theodryians outlandishly talented spellcasters, but also renders them distractible and inattentive.

      The oldest stressors of Divine Intent. These folks arrived unexpectedly, siphoned from realms above, below and beyond the limits of the Midlands proper. Life that does not adhere to the
      standards of Diravol suffers unusual repercussions; mistakes in the worldweave that neglected the idea of non-Inheritor life. While Humans suffer the brunt of it, life is still difficult for the others beyond the
      whims of the Tender's council--everything from magical misfire to cumbersome prophecy will haunt them for as long as they remain here, unless they falsify their transcendent identities entirely. Despite this, many remain in the Midlands their entire lives. Some due to stubbornness,
      but usually it's just because nobody knows how to leave.

  <h2>Ascendants</h2>
  <p>
  The Extended Other, those from higher rungs. As varied as one could imagine the mortal form to be - yet still imposed upon by the bipedal ghost. Anything and everything you could imagine, misplaced and thrown into Dornn without much warning. Lacking in agency and usually stuck under the boot of an Inheritor empire. 
  <br/><br/>
  There are an uncountable number of unidentified Visitors, but about 37 codified Ascendant species hold some territory in the Midlands. Certain groups of Ascendant have grown notorious enough to be granted their own category on the list - these are somewhat callously called the “descended”. 
  <br/><br/>
  Some of the most notorious descended are the Dragons and their progeny, star-crawling pseudo-reptiles from higher on the chitinous leg of the Outer Kosmos. They arrived in a prismatic bolt of dislodged theory long before the First Age, laying their brood wide and low in the recesses of the Earlyworld in wait; biding time for mortal bounties to proliferate and ripen.

Imparting a soul to inert matter is partaking in the sacred acts of the Patrons, of Diravol, of the first.

The scaly form of the Wyrm bent into awkwardly bipedal, Mortal shape--illegitimate participants in the Inheritor’s game. Constantly searching for a method of felling their parriarchs and freeing themselves from the heritor’s curse.

Their children are not so lucky. Faelikes are the only mortals made partially out of magic - unlike any other mortal, if cut-off from Transcendent energies, they will die. Every part of a Faelike’s body is worth a king’s ransom, too--they’re either hiding or on the run, no matter what.

    <p id="padding-scrunch">
    Reformed many times in the wake of worldshaking disaster, the Midland Council is the soul and spine of Dornnian peacetime. Their existence is not a symbolic platitude - the Council 
    is the fulcrum of all traditional politics, the mediator, and an armed force backed by the Sword-Saints that will frequently stamp out potential conflict. In a world where the 
    threat a single rogue agent poses can be planar, the highest level of mortal organization must have the power to decisively prevent such catastrophes. This has, does, and will 
    cause problems when they take action too hastily without full-body consultation.
    <br /> <br />
    The Human Families have tentatively agreed to hold seats at the Council in the years following Draid’s “final” incursion. Their representatives will attend any summit deemed sufficiently-severe, which has only happened
    three times since - the fourth Antikosmic Referendum, the discovery of the Timekeeper's Vault in northern Anterros, and the arrival of named-one "Remus".

    Beyond the apocalyptic coalitions of the semi-mortal west, most polities are hacking it on their own. This is usually--not always, but usually--because they have 
    slightly-askew value systems. The Free Agents of Dornn are not inherently dangerous, but something about them is a bit too unfriendly to make it to the diplomatic chambers. 
    Their territories tend to be smaller than those of the Midland Council or the Human Empires, but they also employ exotic defenses and schemes of war to prevent further 
    border-shoves.

  History is unkind to the Midlands. Most of it has been lost by way of catastrophe, be it cosmic or political, and that which remains paints a confused picture. Many wedges 
  block the way; modern inhabitants hardly resemble their old-world counterparts, the times when Gods and Mortals mingled and warred across the unscarred promise of the preludes. 
  What has instead lasted beyond records of their exploits, imprinted across the flesh and blood of their descendants, are the remnants of their worst mistakes.  Through body-law we 
  trace the truth of Dornnian history, and it is strange indeed.

      <p id="">
      In time unmeasured, a million million years before and after, the Old Gods fought endlessly on battered planes of undecided matter. Their forms were perfect energies, maintained tantrums of Thought and Instrument. 
      Their origins and intentions were not known, but from their perpetual orbit was born the Laws of Reality. It was a time of imprecision, indecision and lots of energy. 
      <br /> <br />
      Somewhere in that roiling sea of every-thought, an incidental clash gave birth to Diravol, the Tender. To abridge their many miracles, the great Patron would be the only "living" creature
      to forge a meaningful relationship with the Old Gods, brokering the five primal Contracts required for Transcendence to mimic the shape of mortal-habitable reality. Life, death, time, space, reason and consequence.

      They crawled from a million holes, some less-formed than others. The divine memory likens it to a “planting”, but they’ve been waiting for this for an unbearable amount of time.

      The long and convoluted rise of the Mortal Folk, the First Inheritors. A time marred by the confusions of a world learning to understand rules as they change underfoot. 
      Patchy records recovered from only the deepest recesses build a frail picture; the First Age was a sequence of incomprehensible wars slowly building towards planar catastrophe.
      The Inheritors struggled to build sensible relationships with their neurotic patrons, and the inextricable differences between them and their neighbors only served to worsen the attempt.
      The only reason the world was stalled from ending at the outset was due to the arrival of a greater foe.

      Oridei had been seeing things for a time. It isn’t certain when or why the King-under-Sky selected him as proper vessel, only that it imposed on his mind for much of the First. A lingering suite of repetitive nightmares: A table in the throat of the heavens with the body of Diravol’s only son seated at one side. 
      A million swords embedded in the windless plains of Moz Haphora’s rolling cradle. Dead titans crashing into manarotted grass. Grey-skinned limbs in ornate boxes. Stormshattered 
      cities in the superstructural depths. A centipede of mortal arms clinging to a blackstone nail at the bottom of the world. The sky as a pastiche of wings and arms, 
      returning home to lift the plane up and away from the growing dark. 
      </i>
      <br /> <br />
      The prophecies remember it well; the turning of the age as a realization of one Divine's ceaseless nightmares. It was perhaps the only extensively documented part, the massive mental decline of Oridei of the Dvirr, the world's
      only "sane" corporeal divine as he was beset by an outsider's hostile visions. When none would respect his calls to action, he took it upon himself to enact the will of Alavaria, the King-under-Sky, and declared war on the world. 
      At first it was a brief and unremarkable string of assassinations and heists. Then, the wings came. A halo of words and light and feathered triumph descended from an overcast sky over Moz Haphora, crowning the Dvirran initiative with the blessing of the Other. 
      Things got a lot worse after that.
      <br /><br />
      The Dvirran wars spanned an age and change, if the records are to be believed. It was the war to end all wars, one not even bested in the grand futures to come. Millions died at the hands 
      of the great Dvirran war-engine, a wanton massacre that culled arbitrarily without reason or remorse. Those that were spared were not forced to work, but to convert--to adopt the will of the
      outsider entity to which Oridei had promised the plane. In the times when they were not fighting (and they were usually fighting), the Dvirr would construct strange devices across the entirety of the Midlands,
      many of which still stand today, uncounted millenia later. The war calendar flexed and withered over the centuries, rebellions swelling into empires before the winged vanguard would return to collect. 
      <br /><br />
      The war's end was only found when Oridei's prophecy-addled hubris ran against a foe he could not topple, and he was killed in remarkably mortal fashion. 
      His immortal patronly soul survived, but not fiercely enough to avoid eternal imprisonment. His remaining forces were abandoned by their new Godhead and stomped out in a meager decade.

      The record fails us. 
      </i>
      <br /> <br />
      This highpoint in a post-patron world is long and fogged, the vast swathes of time wherein most every ruin was built and lost. The technological highs of the Golden Age were riding a wave of magical comprehension so absurd, we might as well be banging rocks together in comparison. Much of the knowledge is foreign to us, based on principles that are dysfunctional in the Seasons of Stagnation. More still was destroyed in the subsequent ages, so the narrow slice of understanding we have for the Golden Age is strange. It was something of a misnomer. 
      <br /> <br />
      The shape of it is vague, a star-crawl to intellectual ascendance marred by complicated and unexpected disaster. The Dwarves built grand subterranean societies that dragged them deeper than they could handle, the Dvirr could not escape their patronly fate and vanished in exodus, the Gnomes met something old in the Krangsway and were scarred forever, the Northfolk were cursed by the death of their second god-chieftain,  the Halflings were shattered by the death of the Mountaincarver hosts, the Elves were fractured and tempted by fragments of their patron's neurotic theories, the Rhominites were devastated by constant internal warfare, and nobody really knows what was going on with the Theodryians. Some groups made it through less-distorted by this age of knowledges, as far as we can tell, but their records are no more complete than any others. There's little in the way of specifics for any of these narratives, only the broadest arcs that survived through legend and word-of-mouth.
      <br /> <br />
      We call it the Golden Age because they managed to stop fighting one another quite as much, but they couldn't quell the internal strife. Apparently, the diplomatic stresses of this meteoric age nearly destroyed the world, if not for what burnt that fuse prematurely...

      Inelegant failures of the Mortal Adherence. In the wake of divine abandonment and repeated patricide, the Inheritors have been abandoned by the faith. All the vectors of progress begin to lean inward--disaster looms. Every juncture meets in one narrow corridor. It could have been anything, from the folly of unchecked advancement to the widening gaps in planar coherence. Plenty of theories. Personally, I just think the poor thing just couldn't handle the pressure. Searing, blistering mana-blitzed static killed three quarters of the world in something akin to an instant. Tyrannical wars between the malcontents of the Upper Spheres carved at the planar crust, scarring landmasses with psychic trenches and phantasm-boundaries. The trillion hands of antimortal intent emerged from every corner of the realm to weigh this new advantage. Things fell apart.

      <br /> <br />
      Faith suffocated, the skies closed like a wound finally healed, and the Midlands were left to rot in blacksun silence; in dead time. The world was wreathed in a paralyzing darkness, lit intermittently by vast bolts of outsider energy that streaked across an empty sky in riverlike patterns. Worldlaw was brittle, time was inconsiderate, space was incoherent. The world grew dependent on the Confidences, narrow strips of land or sea that behaved with a semblance of predictability. Records estimate this Age lasting anywhere from fifteen to six thousand years, depending on the place. Histories were kept through word-of-mouth and the varieties of body-curse observed in corpses from the period--even text did not always work as expected. 
      <br /> <br />
        For most, this age was long and torturous, involving many attempts at reconstructing society that met with extreme opposition. Fresh-formed divinities rejected old magic, rendering nearly all technology useless. A host of new and foreign creatures had invaded the fractured plane, making transport and communication extremely difficult. Something was meddling with the recording and transfer of information, devastating the surviving libraries and storehouses. Most every political body larger than a single settlement died off. Something was lost in this age; separated from the boons of their work, the mortals changed over millennia to adapt to this hostile new paradigm. We only narrowly understand this change, having lost most recorded evidence of it, but it appears that modern mortals do not precisely resemble their old-world counterparts. 
        <br /> <br />
        Sometime, somewhere, the Humans arrive without warning. Dead-world paranoia seats them firmly at the bottom of the power-ladder, as the only mortal creatures without legacy or family to carry them through the dark ages. Their early history is muddled and confused, a foggy mess of subterranean migrations. Nobody recognizes them.

      The realization of Oridei's ambition through differing means. A deal was brokered between five Human visionaries and a nameless titan from the eastern isles, one that would both break the death-spell over the plane and free the Human enclaves from their reclusive masters. It was a bad deal, one even a fool ought to refuse--in exchange for their right to naturality, they would be granted "unconditional immortality." None of the familial parriarchs will comment on why they accepted the bargain.
      <br /> <br />
      While the Human populations were not of one mind regarding this newfound trait, it did not take long for enough of them to rally to their new leaders. In the confused and disorganized Seasons of Regression, no empire was nearly strong enough to fight at all, let alone against a wall of unkillable, vindictive foes. The plane was steamrolled in less than a century with minimal resistance. Sometime during the Invasions, the Old Gods managed to reclaim the celestials, and the shredded sky was restored to old form.
      <br /> <br />
      The Human Age is marred by the confusing political re-evaluations of a deathless empire. As the Humans became more acquainted with their new lifecycles (and the horrid strains it would place upon their bodies), waves of panic and confusion would repeatedly shake at their grasp. Many answers were proposed to solve the issues of overpopulation, mental degradation, divine imposition and magical conspiracy. None took, and the relations between the five human families began to degrade--an opportunity that would allow many of the Inheritors to reclaim some of their old glory.

      <br /> <br />
      Many failures in organization have caused the Human Empires to shrink. The reports grow worse with each passing century; nervously recounting the gradual breakdowns of the Human body in the face of even this meager infinity. They may not die, but their options are unenviable--fall prey to the increasingly popular perpetual death-machines, have your capacity for emotion stolen by a Beast of Causality, or watch as your physical form glacially ages past the precipice of reasonable function, rendering you immobile and thought-strained for an ever-extending eternity. Most retreat in the face of this realization. About seventy-eight percent of all Humans emigrate to the superstructural city-peninsula of Dyrit, where the Sleeping-Halls entomb their consciousness in a kind of suspended animation for the rest of their lives (ergo, forever).
      <br /> <br />
    As the Human Empires slowly crumble under these existential winds, the Mortals begin to retake their old lands. The Humans did a mediocre job of fixing up the post-Armageddon landscapes, so much of the world is a stilted and disjointed array of repopulated ruins and devastated highways. Squabbles between Human holdouts and Mortal bannermen are frequent, but more common are the incursions met between surfacegoers and the newfound host of deranged, ancient Other--Demons, misaligned, and other such things.
    <br /> <br />
    The work ahead is long and difficult. Magic is once again foreign and mostly unknown, technology is traitorous and distrusted (policed, as well), faith is uneasy and based on confusing partial-history, and there are far too many unrecorded hostiles for anyone to contend with. While the massive shadow of Human settlement may have granted a semblance of inhabitability to the plane, it will be a while before the ruin-scarred reaches of Dornn are understood.
