      html: '<p>&emsp;&emsp;&quot;<em>What I want you to be most afraid of in life is assertion. You&#39;re not right, and that wrong-ness is going to hurt somebody. Every idea is made up shit. You have to do it anyways, but all stubborn people die facedown.&quot; - E. Ziediņš, on The Nature of Information, c. 2029</em></p><p></p><p>...and the nature of Responsibility and Information in the twenty-first century, as it were. </p><p>&emsp;&emsp;All words are loaded words - load-bearing words - and, perhaps Baudrillardian (or Ecoic?) in their double-identities as aides, replacements and directors of thought. I&#39;m being needlessly pithy and also pretentious, but there is some substantial benefit in waffling like this, because it selects for the type of loser I&#39;d prefer to reach. This post is pathetically political and under-researched. </p><p>I&#39;ll play with expertises for a moment and take comparison between &#39;words&#39; and programmatic variables. It is somewhat intuitive to understand a variable in programming as a bucket in which a person declares what they ought to store in it (the *type*), and then goes about storing and extracting stuff in the bucket (*assignment*). The confusion, or at least the most persistent kind, is where this metaphor breaks down - because programming is a kind of Babel operation wherein all tokens, operators and functions are constructed of incrementally lesser, more atomic and near-physical operators all the way down to the engagement of individual circuit components by the CPU per instructions delivered. This tower of abstraction has led to a number of intuitive-to-the-engineer solutions that are further removed from the authors of programs, resulting in a kind of &#39;blind intuition barrier&#39; between a number of computational disciplines. Educational programs attempt to mitigate this by holding connections between computer engineering and computer science programs, but the corpus of knowledge required to *intimately* understand each layer of the modern computational architecture aaaallll the way up to your compiled and interpreted languages like Java and Python is dense, to say the least. </p><p>This context is necessary in part to explain that problem I distracted you from - it is the notion of pass-by-reference versus pass-by-value. We use and move <em>variables </em>to dynamically package and manipulate and move information, but the underlying interpreter may not always be doing exactly that. The metaphor one may intuit is that when I &quot;pass&quot; a variable to a <em>function</em> (a chunk of code written to perform a specific task on 0 to many inputs), I am handing the bucket to a laborer so that he may work. The problem is that, in programming, I am only sometimes handing the actual bucket - what we call <em>pass-by-value</em>. Sometimes, for reasons that specifically benefit lower-level architectural concerns of performance, we pass by <em>reference</em> - and now we must explain something about the hardware in order to understand. It should be obvious that all things in a computer program must be <em>stored </em>somehow - otherwise, how would we be able to interact with anything? We have a few paradigms of storage in place to suit our <em>speed </em>needs - some forms of storage are slow to place (write) and retrieve (read) - and in the case of running programs, we require the fastest possible read/write, so we use volatile memory of different types to hold all of our operational information. There can be circumstances, as a result, where we choose to store information elsewhere to save on precious space, and instead put a *reference* to that location in the variable, the bucket - the variable is just holding directions you follow to find the house where your actual stuff is located. Sometimes, though, the variable is really holding the *actual data*. </p><p>The best part is that this further confuses our metaphor - you may want to understand it as handing a laborer either a bucket with a thing in it (value), or a bucket pointing to the real bucket (reference) - but in practice, the real issue is in how functions take inputs, because they do it as a <em>copy</em> of exactly whatever is stored in the variable - so when you &#39;hand the bucket&#39; to your laborer, you need to actually imagine it as giving a <em>copy</em> of that bucket to them. This means that if you manipulate the<em> value </em>bucket, you won&#39;t be changing the stuff in the bucket, just a copy - so if you don&#39;t hand that alteration back properly to the original bucket (called <em>returning</em> a value from a function, which you&#39;d need to reassign to the variable itself or else you&#39;d still be giving back a brand new bucket), nothing will happen. When you get and mess with the stuff that the <em>reference value </em>points to, you <em>don&#39;t </em>need to give anything back, because your copy was just an address pointing you to a real thing you wanted to change - so you just used the copy to walk to where the bucket was and mess with it yourself. The bucket metaphor could still be used here, but it is far less intuitive, given that there are nearly no situations where one would be getting useless copies of their buckets, or being given a bucket holding the directions to locate the bucket where their desired product is hidden - these are natural needs for the discipline of programming that do not map to physical work so easily.</p><p>Whether or not that makes sense, there is an exposed truth here about the nature of knowledge, problematically - our habit of modeling situations into simpler situations is double-edged, and the complexity of a discipline makes it less compatible with our habits of metaphor, simile and simulacra. It is not our interest to investigate that with any specificity - you can intuit the extent of the problem. For any expertise, for any discipline, there are plenty of &#39;landmine axioms&#39; and &#39;antipatterns&#39; - things that seem intuitive and explainable, but produce undesirable or unexpected results because the pattern you applied was grafted from a different discipline of knowledge and lacked context.</p><p>The underlying terror is of the ultimate fault in reasoning - language. Speaking, hearing and viewing are our most efficient sensory tools, so it follows that our communication must be bound in some way to those senses, but it should not be controversial to say those are inexact - our senses are input consumers, and they do not consume the <em>sum total </em>of all possible inputs, so we&#39;re getting only some of all available details - we see a <em>band, </em>a subset<em> </em>of all electromagnetic radiation, as visible light. Still, the <em>resolution</em> of those details is far too high to evaluate with precision, so in order to navigate a reality of impossible resolution with any efficiency, we compartmentalize the infinite nature of things into packages. It is easier to use these packages if we assign something <em>static </em>to them, since we are constantly seeing slight alterations to those packages that may threaten to alter our understanding of them, and we can make noises and markings to represent those packages with relative ease, so: language. The added benefit is mutualism - suddenly, our misaligned <em>packages </em>concerning reality can be brought into alignment through the use of this abstraction - a symbol replaces the thing. Not all trees look like the symbolic tree, but the efficiency is useful so long as everyone knows this is not <em>literally </em>a tree, but merely a reference to the categoric concept of trees. </p><p>Confusion is inevitable - we may live somewhere with a short list of &#39;trees&#39; that look similar, but if we migrate elsewhere, we may suddenly encounter things that are approximately tree-like but far larger and more dangerous, so it could be useful to call them something else. This is also because, as we form these packages, we use them to inform behavior: small growths on some bushes are <em>berries. </em>Eat <em>berries </em>to survive. Move somewhere, find similar object, berry-like - eat it. Poison! You are now dead. This is what predisposes language to the tendencies of evolution - misuses of packaged concepts will kill, maim or behaviorally select themselves out of the concept pool - ergo, the group will respond by re-packaging concepts to accommodate these dangers, or a group with a bad conceptual packaging will die off and not be able to spread their bad inventory. In a purely survivalistic sense, language <em>should </em>self-select into only useful packages, since there&#39;s still a single motive - it doesn&#39;t matter how confused any group gets about what is or isn&#39;t <em>tree</em>, or what is or isn&#39;t <em>food, </em>because death pressure will, on average, eliminate environmentally-misaligned packages of interpretation. </p><p>If you&#39;ve ever attempted to invent a game of some kind, or to reconfigure the rules of a game for your own use, you may find that it takes little time for the introduction of rules to result in unexpected drift. People will use oversights in the rules, or inexact language, or wilfully-uncooperative interpretation to do things that go against your intentions. This, too, is that imprecise relation of resolution between reality and the communication of it - in general, because our powerful-but-inexact senses are impossible for us to describe exactly, our two-steps-removed relationship to reality is a tremendous challenge to keep &#39;coherent&#39; with that actual, practical experience of reality. It would seem that our common needs would keep stable the nature of concepts, but as one might be able to intuit, the greater confusions of human organization do not tend to agree. In a manner of speaking, then, all human problems are *confusions of common motive* or *competition over limitations*. Is this anprim propaganda?</p><p>No. I&#39;m not a moron - the obvious issue evoked by arguing for a &#39;primitive return&#39; is that we I. know there are benefits preferable even to primitive motive-sets that can only be found through large-scale social organization and that II. any large-scale social organization will produce *novel needs* that are not directly-correlated with the procedures of survival. This is about how the distribution of labor causes lifestyles and what they require to change, or the <em>atomicity of labor</em> and <em>specialization optimization issues - </em>as groups scale, their efficiency at a task actually starts to suffer in unusual ways, so it becomes important to segment. Generalism is not useful in larger groups - if you try and have everybody in your group hunting, cleaning, cooking, building, purifying water, caring for the young and the ill, mediating conflict, etc...they will all become intensely-inefficient at nearly all of these tasks. On the other side, too, the most efficient methods of performing these tasks often take increasing amounts of dedication, cultivation of skill and committment to maintain, so it is self-evident to segment your population into groups that perform specific tasks and provide for the deficiencies of other groups. As you grow in size, a few things happen:</p><p>- <em>Innovation </em>is formalized. It is possible for a simple process to be re-evaluated and altered. Perhaps hunting parties realize they find greater returns when smaller groups are sent, or when their hunters wear camoflauge, or when a variety of hunter builds can tolerate unexpected outcomes. The invention of agriculture and irrigation, of forging and material-work, all of these are <em>more likely to occur </em>when more <em>people and resources </em>are centralized.</p><p>- <em>Reaction to innovation </em>and <em>organization </em>produce <em>strange needs. </em>Forging is a specific process with unique resource requirements. The results are generally-beneficial - often outrageously so, massively-improving resilience for your resource producers and...perhaps...soldiery (another thing!) - but they now require  acquisition. At first, the smiths may need to do it themselves, but <em>organizers </em>will recognize a benefit to allowing the smith to remain a smith for more time--more throughput, more training, more stuff--and so the work of acquisiton moves elsewhere - trade is born of pressures like this. Trade is a practice that is now two steps removed from primal needs - not improvement of those needs, but improvement of the improvers of those needs. This is what I would call <em>strange - </em>as it subsegments to grow in efficiency, it becomes increasingly less likely of an artifact in <em>disorganized </em>groups. One could hypothesize the formation of consistent trade and further, specific trade between primal groups coincidentally, but not consistently, and the further segmentation of roles within a large trade operation are highly unlikely to form. These are <em>strange roles </em>with <em>strange needs. </em>Currency is a <em>strange need</em> in a lesser sense, but minted/precious currency is a <em>superior strange need </em>because it only comes about as a consequence of the system itself.</p><p>- <em>The diversification and innovation of practices confuses the populace. </em>It becomes increasingly-difficult for the full population to understand what goes into the full scope of facilitating their society. These confusions will begin to produce conflicts. Most people still run on zero to one degrees of abstraction, performing tasks that they intuit as useful or have sufficient education to understand as such. The increasing distance of understanding between people of different disciplines will forment distrust as they attempt to evaluate the efficacy of these practices without the requisite knowledge (which becomes closer and closer to impossible), so conflict breaks out. This is how a conflict resolution system is necessitated, which will seed the need for <em>government</em>, as large settlements without systems of rule and resolution will collapse more often than not. People&#39;s tendency towards understandable systems will promote simpler governments, so you see a lot of &#39;charisma leads to monarchic rule&#39;. A natural impulse for security and control will promote the early development of <em>political pressure, </em>the need for a politician to preserve their status through enforcement, maneuver, manipulation and lineage - the <em>divine right of kings</em>, in a word. Still, popular policy is necessary to avoid death by revolution, so it is semistable - but this uplifting of conflict resolution abstracts <em>it</em> and develops a new system of <em>power</em> that is no longer coupled with the control of resources or other limiting factors, making yet another <em>strange domain </em>the populace does not intuitively understand.</p><p>- <em>The need for specific rule forces complicated questions. </em>Notions of property, responsibility and virtue begin to invade communication - concepts that are somewhat unnecessary in a purely-survivalistic sense, but also exist in all groups in some form.  As that need for stable mediation increases, people seek root answers to inform the organization of <em>rule</em>. People attempt to form systems of <em>ownership, </em>of <em>self, </em>of <em>good</em>, of <em>bad </em>and of <em>correction</em>. This is a useful, but corrupted process, because the people attempting to make these core judgements are already subject to the confused experiences of social organization. Identification and reinforcement, being the only source of evidence, become mis-correlated with lower-level truths, and glaring gaps in knowledge demand larger-scale answers - <em>science </em>and <em>religion </em>form as disciplines of investigating base truths. The notion of social structure <em>beyond </em>responsibility to primal need is formalized, and you begin to see bindings form between trait, observation and responsibility - <em>women </em>have the kids, so they care for them<em>. </em>Millenia of biological reinforcement have made this a somewhat foregone conclusion, though environment and lower-level quirks can deny it.<em> </em>Disproportionate exposure to the practice of care miscorrelates <em>women</em>&#39;s basic nature to that of <em>caretaking, </em>and this notion is quietly propagated until it calcifies, reinforcing and <em>enforcing </em>the behavior. Later scientific inquiry attempts to correlate or deny these traits, but is itself bound to <em>preconceptions </em>that a pattern ought to be taken as proof or refutation of an idea, making the information itself imperfect. </p><p>More generally, <em>science </em>and <em>religion </em>reinforce their need differently and take on different motives - <em>science </em>often worsens confusion, but produces very practical results, so it sees uneven support from the groups it intermittently bolsters. <em>religion </em>assuages confusion and is rapidly adopted, as it mimicks the sense of certainty that those 0 to 1-layer survivalist intuitives do, while also adopting the texture of the currently-forming <em>social order </em>we just talked about. This coupling better describes how <em>emotional reinforcement </em>works - as an evolutionary imperative, emotions are used as a dynamic way to retain behaviors in response to stimuli. When social order forms, that evolutionary impetus is mismapped onto a much more convoluted system, and so we see emotional reinforcement become highly-individuated (specialization consequence) and frequently skewed towards behaviors that are not general, or are similarly-coupled with those bindings between traits, observations and patterns - so people not only develop unusual couplings of belief, they also develop unusual emotional reliances on those couplings. Religion thrives in this space as a coupling of all of the above - intuitives, observables (particularly of discrete forces that are not yet understood scientifically), social-emotional bindings - and uses them to form otherwise-nonexistent spaces of &#39;false reality&#39; that can then drive large groups of people into cooperation that would otherwise be difficult to achieve. This makes it appealing to people in power as an instrument of retention and accumulation, but with the obvious caveat that it can easily run away from the ambitions of the &#39;controlling party&#39; and end up disadvantaging them. Religion also engages in a competition with science as they occasionally produce competing answers to the same question, and people err practical in pursuit of security - ergo, they side with religious truth until scientific truth produces a provable and practical benefit to them.</p><p>The most interesting thing about this little domain analysis of primitive human social truth I&#39;ve done is that it is marred with broad categorizations that are deeply-flawed and able to be contradicted directly <em>and </em>indirectly. This is because I have attempted to describe the structural composition of human social reality using I. <em>language</em> and II. <em>my deeply-uninformed subjective worldview. </em>Here is where I get to speak out of both sides of my mouth, because I am at once describing to you <em>why </em>I believe we operate as we do with language as it is, <em>and </em>why I think there does not exist any meaningful capacity to describe anything precisely in that way. Is this the thesis?</p><p>We live, now, in the year 2025 (or later, but likely not earlier) under a social climate that is itself a Babel of social convolution and hyperdependent information. All expertises are at once developed beyond any single human&#39;s capacity for understanding <em>and </em>deeply-entangled with all other disciplines in a sociopolitical war of conceptual instability. If we can understand our words for all their vulnerabilities, for their nature as packages inexact then subject to all the little wars of interpretation, emotional re-enforcement, religio-scientific conflict, strange need development and interdisciplinary conflict - then we should not struggle to understand <em>why </em>it now feels impossible to derive even an ounce of truth from any writing, any speech, any pursuit. Confusion is the name of the game, and we&#39;re only making it faster, more adaptable, more vulnerable. My metaphor returns in force, now, having shrugged off the barrelesque sub-metaphor beneath it  (or consumed it?) - when you&#39;re conversing about common issues with a peer, are you both passing your little word-variables around by value or by reference? What is contained in that package--a reference to common understanding, or a copy inexact? When your conversant takes your copy, do they modify it themselves? Do they return that modification to you with all honesty? The joke is that this metaphor is dependent on a domain unrelated that I have emotional investment in, and so it fails to capture the contextual complexities of linguistics and may lead to your misinterpretation of the point. My favorite word in the english language is <em>misalignment. </em></p><p><em>...</em>and yes, obviously, the quote at the top is fake.</p>'
